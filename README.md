# Binary-tree-traversal-to-find-defective-lightbulbs-using-multi-threading
Consider there is a series of lightbulbs connected in a sequential manner. In this situation, if one of the bulbs is defective it will cause all the bulbs to be off. A potential solution to find quickly the faulty bulb(s) is to divide recursively the series into subseries and keep investigating the subseries that do not show light. We assume the subseries with no faulty bulb(s) will show light.
